'D&D 4e Offline Character Builder' created by Wizards of the Coast (www.wizards.com).
'Character Builder Loader' created by the CBLoader team (github.com/cbloader/cbloader).

## INSTALLATION
1. Download [install_cb.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawfulstupid/CB-Installer/main/install_cb.bat) (right click and select 'save link as...' / 'save target as...')
2. Run install_cb.bat, and follow the instructions in the command window.
A start menu shortcut and desktop shortcut for "DnD 4e Character Builder" will be made.

## NOTES
- 7-zip is required to unpack program files, which you can get for free from www.7-zip.org. It's better than WinRAR.
- I recommend running [uninstall_cb.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawfulstupid/CB-Installer/main/uninstall_cb.bat) first if you have at any point had the character builder installed before.
- Once the installer begins downloading program files, it won't need your input anymore.
- Characters you make with the Character Builder will, by default, be saved in "My Documents\ddi\Saved Characters" as .dnd4e files.
- "How To Install Character Builder For Dummies.txt" contains steps for manual installation, which install_cb.bat automates. You can use this if you encounter bugs.
- Run 'install_cb.bat -h' for command-line arguments.
